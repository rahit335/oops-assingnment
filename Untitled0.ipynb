        "\n",
        "### 1. **What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**\n",
        "\n",
        "OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which contain data (attributes) and code (methods). It emphasizes reuse, modularity, and abstraction through four main principles: **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and **abstraction**.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **What is a class in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects (instances) will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **What is an object in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "An object is an instance of a class. It contains real values stored in attributes and can perform actions using the class's methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Abstraction** hides complex implementation details and shows only essential features.\n",
        "* **Encapsulation** binds data and methods together and restricts direct access to some components.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **What are dunder methods in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Dunder (double underscore) methods like `__init__`, `__str__`, and `__len__` are special methods used to define behavior for standard Python operations (e.g., object creation, printing, arithmetic).\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. **Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance allows a class (child) to acquire attributes and methods from another class (parent), enabling code reuse and hierarchical classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. **What is polymorphism in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism allows different classes to define methods with the same name but different behaviors. It enables the same interface to be used with different underlying data types.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 8. **How is encapsulation achieved in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation is achieved using private variables (`__varname`) and getter/setter methods to control access and modification of data.\n",

        "\n",
        "### 9. **What is a constructor in Python?**\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "* **Class methods** (`@classmethod`) take `cls` as a parameter and can modify class state.\n",
        "* **Static methods** (`@staticmethod`) don't take `self` or `cls` and are utility functions within a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 11. **What is method overloading in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Python doesn't support traditional method overloading. Instead, default arguments or `*args`/`**kwargs` are used to handle multiple input types.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 12. **What is method overriding in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "It is redefining a method in the child class that already exists in the parent class. The child class method takes precedence.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 13. **What is a property decorator in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "`@property` is used to turn a method into a read-only attribute, providing controlled access to class data.\n",

        "### 14. **Why is polymorphism important in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism enhances flexibility and scalability by allowing objects of different classes to be treated uniformly via a common interface.\n",

        "### 15. **What is an abstract class in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "An abstract class contains one or more abstract methods (declared but not implemented). It cannot be instantiated directly. Use `abc` module.\n",

        "### 18. **What is multiple inheritance in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "A class can inherit from multiple parent classes. This allows a child class to access attributes and methods from all parents.\n",

        "### 19. **Explain the purpose of `__str__` and `__repr__` in Python.**\n",
        "\n",
        "* `__str__`: Returns a user-friendly string.\n",
        "* `__repr__`: Returns a developer-oriented string for debugging.\n",

        "\n",
        "* `@staticmethod` doesn't receive `self` or `cls`.\n",

        "### 23. **How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Through method overriding, different subclasses can define their own version of a method, enabling polymorphic behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 24. **What is method chaining in Python OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "It allows multiple method calls on the same object in a single line by returning `self` from each method.\n",
        "\n",

        "### 25. **What is the purpose of the `__call__` method in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Allows an instance of a class to be called like a function by defining `__call__`. It adds function-like behavior to objects.\n",
